## X's New Policy on Biometric Data Collection: Concerns and Implications
In this document, I explore two contrasting viewpoints on X's (formerly Twitter) new biometric data collection policy that will come into force on Sep 29 2023, highlighting the balance between user consent and potential privacy implications.

X has recently revised its privacy policy, signaling its intent to gather users' biometric, employment, and educational details. Effective from September 29, this updated policy will use biometric data for safety and security purposes based on user consent. The policy also indicates plans to leverage users' employment and educational data for job recommendations, potential employer matches, and targeted advertising. 

### Dr. Stephanie Hare's Viewpoint:
Dr. Hare identifies the recent data collection policy changes by X (formerly Twitter) as a significant data acquisition, albeit one done with user consent. While recognizing the extent of the data collection, she does not see this move as disturbing from a civil liberties perspective, given its non-compulsory nature for users.

Dr. Hare brings up an essential aspect of data collection: consent. In a world where data has become a valuable currency, obtaining user consent is a critical factor. The notion that consent neutralizes concerns about civil liberties, however, may not resonate with everyone. One can argue that while users technically have a choice, the lines become blurred when platforms become as ubiquitous and integral to daily life as X. The "choice" can sometimes be between participating in a modern digital society and guarding one's data privacy. Moreover, not all users are fully aware of or understand the implications of giving such consent. In an ideal scenario, platforms would provide clearer, more detailed explanations of their data use, enabling users to make truly informed decisions.

### Nora Benavidez's Viewpoint:
Contrasting with Dr. Hare's viewpoint, Nora Benavidez expresses deeper concerns about the recent changes in X's data collection policies. She asserts that such data collection methods are increasingly common but often unrecognized by users in terms of the implications for their privacy and free expression rights. A specific worry she raises is the potential for the platform's data, under its new leadership, to be handed over to authoritarian regimes that may request it.

Nora Benavidez underscores a dark potentiality that can arise from such vast data collection: the misuse of data in the hands of authoritarian regimes. This argument shifts the discussion from not just personal privacy but also to broader socio-political implications. History has shown us that information, when wielded by authoritarian figures or regimes, can become a tool for suppression, discrimination, or worse. It’s a valid concern, considering how deeply intertwined platforms like X are with socio-political discourses worldwide. The trust users place in such platforms is paramount, and leaders of these platforms have a responsibility to ensure that data does not become a weapon against the very users who populate and sustain them. This argument brings forward the necessity of establishing clear, rigorous, and ethical data handling and sharing standards, especially when dealing with regimes that have questionable human rights records.
Aside from that, if X does starts offering job searching and recommendation tools in the near future, it doesn't just hold our tweets but our professional aspirations and histories too. Mismanagement or wilful sharing of such data can have life-altering implications for many.
